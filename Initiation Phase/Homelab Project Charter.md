**Addressed Problem**  
There are many job opportunities that are relevant to the career path I would like to grow in. Unfortunately, I lack the experience working with some of the tools, techniques, and concepts that are required.

**Purpose**  
To continue building skills and knowledge that are relevant to my career field, having a homelab will enable me to safely experiment with new technologies and techniques without affecting the live network. Moreover, a homelab will enable me to build up marketable skills while providing me with a continuous learning cycle.

**Objective**

- Create a network designed for testing tools and technology  
- Design a portable and easily deployable homelab

**Scope**  
Develop a mobile and easily deployable homelab network to foster a safe testing environment for learning new skills and technologies. The homelab will not be deployed outside nor around the house; it will be deployed in my room. All equipment must be personally owned, lightweight, and compact. Time to set up and take down must be 10 minutes or less. The homelab will require internet access either through nesting within the LAN or directly connecting to the router, and there will be no direct access to the modem. 

**Project Description**

1. **Network Characteristics**  
   1. Automate device configuration and deployment  
   2. Allow authorized devices to access the lab  
   3. Physical or wireless access to the internet   
   4. Wireless-based infrastructure

2. **Equipment Characteristics**  
   1. A blend of physical and virtual devices  
   2. Equipment easily fits in a backpack and light to carry around  
   3. Capable of wirelessly connecting to the lab *\*\*physical devices* 

**Risks**

* Physical devices unable to integrate and function with virtual devices  
* Devices unable to be automated or unable to centrally manage  
* Denied internet access  
* Equipment is bulkier or heavier than expected  
* Equipment is broken or insufficient  
* Wireless interference inhibiting accessibility  
* Backpack breaks  
* Traffic from the lab negatively impacts the LAN  
* Unauthorized user access the lab  
* Equipment is compromised with malware

**Constraints**

* The project must be completed within the $150 budget  
* Required hardware and software will be procured before the start of the project  
* Internet connectivity is dependent upon owner’s approval  
* Majority of connections must be wireless  
* Equipment must be capable of fitting into a backpack  
* Total weight cannot exceed 7kg   
* Lab setup and take down times must be 10 minutes or less

**Assumptions**

* Access to electricity and power outlets  
* Access to an area to setup
