# Josh's Homelab
**This repository serves to document and display my experience of setting up a homelab. There are two main objectives for this project, and they are:**

1) **Create a functional network for testing and learning new technologies, tools, and skills**
2) **Make this lab portable and easily deployable**


With these objectives in mind, I'm excited to document and share my struggles and successes as I pursue them! As another thing to note, this will be an ongoing project. So expect frequent updates and changes to this repository.

## Overview
To start this project, I divided it into several phases. This will make it easier to manage and execute. These phases are the Initiation Phase, the Planning Phase, the Execution Phase, the Control Phase, and the Completition Phase.
### Initiation Phase:
The Initiation Phase establishes the need for a project by justifying it, identityfing goals & key stakeholders, and recieving approval to start. Information is collected and presented regarding risks, assumptions, requirements, cost, and time. A major deliverable from this phase is the **Project Charter**. This document summarizes the purpose of the project, its benefits, and a high-level overview of requirements and execution. Essentially, the document ensures that everyone is in agreement regarding the project while establishing a foundation for the remaining phases of the project. 

### Planning Phase:
Following after the Initation Phase, the Planning Phase establishes a clear road map detailing how the project should be completed, what work will be accomplished, who will do that work, how much time will be allocated, etc. The main deliverable of this phase is the **Project Plan**. This plan is a collection of multiple documents that addresses the specifics of the road map. 

One crucial document associated with the plan is the **Scope Statement**. This document specifices what the project will and will not accomplish. Without it, a project may be easily susceptible to Scope Creep. **Scope Creep** is a phenomena which a project's needs, goals, objective, etc. uncontrollably grows throughout the project's life. As a result of this controllable growth, a project may take longer to complete, become more expensive to achieve, or completely fail. Note that there are other crucial documents, i.e. **The Work Breakdown Strucuture**, that are similar in importance; thus having them incoperated into the Project Plan will increase a project's sucess. 

### Execution Phase:


### Control Phase:

### Completion Phase:

### The Project's Ending
After all phases are completed, the project will be over and an analysis will be performed. This analysis will summarize the skills that I have learned and determine whether or not this project has met its goals. Dependent upon the success of this project, it will either examine the factors that made this project successful or the factors that made it unsucessful, hopefully, the former rather than the latter. Overall, I hope that this project accurately represents my capabilities and serves as an example for others.
