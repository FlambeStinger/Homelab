# Josh's Homelab
**This repository serves to document and display my experience of setting up a homelab. There are two main objectives for this project, and they are:**

1) **Create a functional network for testing and learning new technologies, tools, and skills**
2) **Make this lab portable and easily deployable**


With these objectives in mind, I'm excited to document and share my struggles and successes as I pursue them! As another thing to note, this will be an ongoing project without a planned date for completition. So expect frequent updates and changes to this repository.

## Overview
To begin this project, I will be dividing it into several phases. This will make it easier to manage and execute. These phases will be the Infrastructure Phase, the Services Phase, and the Improvement Phase.
