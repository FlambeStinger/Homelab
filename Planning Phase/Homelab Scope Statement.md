| Scope Description  Develop an automated, portable, and secure homelab network for testing new technologies and tools that is capable of being deployed within 10 minutes for hand-on IT skill development. |
| ----- |
| **In Scope**  Equipment Procurement Utilize have-on hand equipment such as Google Wifi AC1304 Access Points (APs), TP Link Powerline AV1200 APs, crimped CAT 5e and 6a cabling, HP Envy x360 Laptop, Lenovo Laptop, and power cords Acquire all necessary software components such as OpenWRT installation file, Docker, Kubernetes, Container Labs, VirtualBox, etc. Purchase necessary hardware equipment and tools to cover for the requirements that the have-on hands equipment are unable to meet Network Configuration and Management Automate network configuration with OpenWISP and container deployment with Ansible. Establish DHCP and DNS services  Utilize Splunk for gathering telemetry Establish a separate subnet and VLAN for managing the network devices Network Security  Configure firewall rules on OpenWRT node connecting to the Internet Deploy and configure a container running FreeRadius for 802.1X wireless authentication  Disable unused ports and radios on all access points End Host Configuration Install VMWare, Docker, and Kubernetes on to Lenovo Laptop Utilize HP Envy x360 Laptop for management and client testing  Deployment Capable of being deployed within the lab room and packed away in a standard backpack Documentation Develop an easy-to-read documentation describing the network topologies, configurations, and deployment Functionality Testing Perform basic tests to ensure that devices across the network can communicate with each other and the internet Time the time it takes to setup the lab and pack it away Test the backpack’s weight w/ the equipment inside Maintenance Tools and Plan Develop a maintenance plan and a set of maintenance scripts Write a troubleshoot guide detailing common problems and their solutions  |
| **Out of Scope**  Services  The lab will not offer its services outside of the network (i.e. LAN) nor its resources Deployment Location The homelab will not be deployed outside of the lab room Modem Accessibility The network will not directly connect to the modem Limited Physical-based Network The project’s primary focus is on a virtualized network environment. Physical hardware will be limited to the core components that are necessary to run the lab Cloud Integration No cloud integration with providers such as AWS or Google Cloud. The lab will be a complete on-premise solution  |
